THis script assumes the fodlers generated by NSG sequencer are manually fed as arguemnts. If we have to exctarct the list of folders frm some location then we may need to rewrite the for loop logic with some minimal changes

USAGE ./sync_script.sh /home/nadarb/folder1   /home/nadarb/folder2          ####list the fodler path as arguemnt to the script

OR

./sync_script.sh fodler1 fodler2 fodler3     ####if the script and the fodlers are in the working directory
